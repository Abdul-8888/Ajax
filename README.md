# Ajax
### Description
The developed project is a demo application to better understand the working and implementation of Ajax. The application uses a free API from [OpenMeteo](https://github.com](https://open-meteo.com)https://open-meteo.com). It provides weather report of a region provied; longitude and latitude of the region. It also displays the date and hourly time at which the reading was taken. Simple html, css and js are used for the app to get to the depth of the concept of Ajax.

### Instructions
The application can be run in almost any code editor. Just clone the project and you are ready to go. Using simply html, css and js need no extra libraries, software or packages to install. Recommended editor is VS Code.

### Benefits
After the successful completion and testin of the app, it was found that Ajax enhanced user experience by a lot. Without using Ajax, the whole page was reloaded everytime there was some request to the server and UI was frozen. Ajax solved this issue.
